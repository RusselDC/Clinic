-	We strongly recommend that make sure the device is connected to internet before using this
system because some components used for this system strongly depends on internet connection
example:
bootstrap
phpmailer

-	If you are using third party security apps like avast anti-virus, we recommend on
turning it off before using the application because it causes an error for the phpmailer.
It's safe to do because we already tried on doing it on a different device and nothing 
bad happens.
